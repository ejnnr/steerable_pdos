Steerable PDO support for the E2CNN library
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**This branch is DEPRECATED!**
It is partially undocumented and partially broken.
I'm keeping it only as a historical record and because it is currently
the only place with experimental point cloud support (if you're interested
in using that, it's probably best to [contact me](mailto:erik.jenner99@gmail.com)).

If you want to set up this library for our experiments, see the instructions in
[our experiments repo](https://github.com/ejnnr/steerable_pdo_experiments).
If you are looking for the code that supports the PDO-eConv basis, see
the [pdo_econv branch](https://github.com/ejnnr/steerable_pdos/tree/pdo_econv).
